    "# Blog-Post about genome-scale metabolic modeling\n",
    "This Blog-post is an introduction into genome-scale metabolic models (GSMMs). For this purpose the model iYli21 is used. How to interact with these models is implemented in the following notebook using a python framework for Constraint-based Reconstruction and Analysis (COBRA) called COBRApy.\n",
    "\n",
    "At first the imports and setup is presented. Afterwards it is shown that a model consists of reactions, metabolies and genes. To get an intuition how this information could be used in practice there is a short example of how to skim through the components and build a table from this information. The model presentation is followed by a simulation. So the implementation of a flux balance analysis (FBA) is shown. The last part is about adding a pathway into the model. In this case the galactose pathway is added which is useful for the digestion of lignocellulosic biomass. \n",
